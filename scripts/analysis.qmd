This graph shows a uniform COVID-19 shock across these six countries in 2020, followed by divergent recovery trajectories. The general drop in 2020 indicates a disruption to all the labor markets; however, the speed and robustness of the subsequent recovery varied considerably.

Norway shows the most resilient pattern: following a marginal decrease in 2020, its employment ratio rapidly rebounded, passing pre-pandemic levels by 2022. This performance indicates a robust labor market and successful economic stabilization policies.

The UK also recovered, albeit at a slower pace, stabilizing slightly below its 2019 peak. This suggests the persistence of post-pandemic labor shortages and structural economic adjustments. Portugal experienced a notable contraction in 2020 but showed a consistent recovery through 2023, reflecting the gradual reabsorption of workers as the tourism and services sectors reopened.

Albania endured a sharper pandemic-era decline than its Western European counterparts but subsequently demonstrated a powerful resurgence, surpassing its pre-COVID levels by 2022. This trajectory may be attributed to enhanced labor participation or rapid recovery in key domestic industries.

Italy consistently maintains the lowest employment ratio. While the COVID-19 crisis exacerbated its underlying structural weaknesses, the nation has registered a modest upward trend since 2021. This improvement, while discernible, remains constrained by long-standing challenges, particularly low rates of female and youth employment.

In contrast, Ukraine's path deviates significantly from the broader recovery pattern. Following its 2020 decline, its employment ratio continued to fall after 2021 due to the ongoing conflict. This decline reflects large-scale population displacement, widespread economic disruption, and severe demographic shocks. Collectively, the data illustrate that while most European nations had recovered from the COVID-19 impact by 2022 or 2023, Ukraine's situation underscores the profound and protracted effects of conflict on labor markets and overall economic stability.
